<p><strong>Large scale sequence alignment via efficient inference in generative models.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37142645/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37142645</a></p>
<p>Finding alignments between millions of reads and genome sequences is crucial in computational biology. Since the standard alignment algorithm has a large computational cost, heuristics have been developed to speed up this task. Though orders of magnitude faster, these methods lack theoretical guarantees and often have low sensitivity especially when reads have many insertions, deletions, and mismatches relative to the genome. Here we develop a theoretically principled and efficient algorithm that has high sensitivity across a wide range of insertion, deletion, and mutation rates. We frame sequence alignment as an inference problem in a probabilistic model. Given a reference database of reads and a query read, we find the match that maximizes a log-likelihood ratio of a reference read and query read being generated jointly from a probabilistic model versus independent models. The brute force solution to this problem computes joint and independent probabilities between each query and reference pair, and its complexity grows linearly with database size. We introduce a bucketing strategy where reads with higher log-likelihood ratio are mapped to the same bucket with high probability. Experimental results show that our method is more accurate than the state-of-the-art approaches in aligning long-reads from Pacific Bioscience sequencers to genome sequences.</p>

<p><strong>Selective pertraction of dicarboxylic acids from simulated Rhizopus oryzae fermentation broths.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37137961/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37137961</a></p>
<p>Fumaric, malic and succinic acids have been selectively separated by facilitated pertraction with Amberlite LA-2, using n-heptane as liquid membrane. The feed phase consisted on viscous aqueous solution with similar mixture of carboxylic acids and viscosity as those of Rhizopus oryzae fermentation broth. Due to the differences between the acidities and molecule size of these acids, it is possible to selectively recover fumaric acid from the initial solution. The pH-gradient between the feed and stripping phases, as well as carrier concentration in the liquid membrane represent the main process parameters influencing the pertraction selectivity. Among them, Amberlite LA-2 concentration exhibits the most important control on the selectivity factor S, the maximum value of S being reached for carrier concentration of 30 g/l. The increase of feed phase viscosity amplified the magnitude of these influences on pertraction selectivity, due to the hindrance of acids diffusion towards the region where their reaction with Amberlite LA-2 occurs, effect more important for malic acid. Therefore, by modifying the viscosity from 1 to 24 cP, the maximum value of selectivity factor was increased from 12 to 18.8.</p>

<p><strong>Electrical impedance myography detects age-related skeletal muscle atrophy in adult zebrafish.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37137956/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37137956</a></p>
<p>Age-related deficits in skeletal muscle function, termed sarcopenia, are due to loss of muscle mass and changes in the intrinsic mechanisms underlying contraction. Sarcopenia is associated with falls, functional decline, and mortality. Electrical impedance myography (EIM)-a minimally invasive, rapid electrophysiological tool-can be applied to animals and humans to monitor muscle health, thereby serving as a biomarker in both preclinical and clinical studies. EIM has been successfully employed in several species; however, the application of EIM to the assessment of zebrafish-a model organism amenable to high-throughput experimentation-has not been reported. Here, we demonstrated differences in EIM measures between the skeletal muscles of young (6 months of age) and aged (33 months of age) zebrafish. For example, EIM phase angle and reactance at 2 kHz showed significantly decreased phase angle (5.3 ± 2.1 versus 10.7 ± 1.5°; p = 0.001) and reactance (89.0 ± 3.9 versus 172.2 ± 54.8 ohms; p = 0.007) in aged versus young animals. Total muscle area, in addition to other morphometric features, was also strongly correlated to EIM 2 kHz phase angle across both groups (r = 0.7133, p = 0.01). Moreover, there was a strong correlation between 2 kHz phase angle and established metrics of zebrafish swimming performance, including turn angle, angular velocity, and lateral motion (r = 0.7253, r = 0.7308, r = 0.7857, respectively, p < 0.01 for all). In addition, the technique was shown to have high reproducibility between repeated measurements with a mean percentage difference of 5.34 ± 1.17% for phase angle. These relationships were also confirmed in a separate replication cohort. Together, these findings establish EIM as a fast, sensitive method for quantifying zebrafish muscle function and quality. Moreover, identifying the abnormalities in the bioelectrical properties of sarcopenic zebrafish provides new opportunities to evaluate potential therapeutics for age-related neuromuscular disorders and to interrogate the disease mechanisms of muscle degeneration.</p>

<p><strong>External validation of a radiomic signature to predict p16 (HPV) status from standard CT images of anal cancer patients.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37137947/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37137947</a></p>
<p>The paper deals with the evaluation of the performance of an existing and previously validated CT based radiomic signature, developed in oropharyngeal cancer to predict human papillomavirus (HPV) status, in the context of anal cancer. For the validation in anal cancer, a dataset of 59 patients coming from two different centers was collected. The primary endpoint was HPV status according to p16 immunohistochemistry. Predefined statistical tests were performed to evaluate the performance of the model. The AUC obtained here in anal cancer is 0.68 [95% CI (0.32-1.00)] with F1 score of 0.78. This signature is TRIPOD level 4 (57%) with an RQS of 61%. This study provides proof of concept that this radiomic signature has the potential to identify a clinically relevant molecular phenotype (i.e., the HPV-ness) across multiple cancers and demonstrates potential for this radiomic signature as a CT imaging biomarker of p16 status.</p>

<p><strong>A machine learning method for the identification and characterization of novel COVID-19 drug targets.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37137934/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37137934</a></p>
<p>In addition to vaccines, the World Health Organization sees novel medications as an urgent matter to fight the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. One possible strategy is to identify target proteins, for which a perturbation by an existing compound is likely to benefit COVID-19 patients. In order to contribute to this effort, we present GuiltyTargets-COVID-19 ( https://guiltytargets-covid.eu/ ), a machine learning supported web tool to identify novel candidate drug targets. Using six bulk and three single cell RNA-Seq datasets, together with a lung tissue specific protein-protein interaction network, we demonstrate that GuiltyTargets-COVID-19 is capable of (i) prioritizing meaningful target candidates and assessing their druggability, (ii) unraveling their linkage to known disease mechanisms, (iii) mapping ligands from the ChEMBL database to the identified targets, and (iv) pointing out potential side effects in the case that the mapped ligands correspond to approved drugs. Our example analyses identified 4 potential drug targets from the datasets: AKT3 from both the bulk and single cell RNA-Seq data as well as AKT2, MLKL, and MAPK11 in the single cell experiments. Altogether, we believe that our web tool will facilitate future target identification and drug development for COVID-19, notably in a cell type and tissue specific manner.</p>

<p><strong>Cholesterol biosynthesis modulates differentiation in murine cranial neural crest cells.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37127649/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37127649</a></p>
<p>Cranial neural crest cells (cNCC) are a multipotent embryonic cell population that give rise to a diverse set of cell types. These cells are particularly vulnerable to external metabolic stressors, as exemplified by the association between maternal hyperglycemia and congenital malformations. We were interested in studying the effect of various concentrations of glucose and pyruvate on cNCC metabolism, migration, and differentiation using an established murine neural crest cell model (O9-1). We unexpectedly observed a pattern of gene expression suggestive of cholesterol biosynthesis induction under glucose depletion conditions in O9-1 cells. We further showed that treatment with two different cholesterol synthesis inhibitors interfered with cell migration and differentiation, inhibiting chondrogenesis while enhancing smooth muscle cell differentiation. As congenital arhinia (absent external nose), a malformation caused by mutations in SMCHD1, appears to represent, in part, a defect in cNCC, we were also interested in investigating the effects of glucose and cholesterol availability on Smchd1 expression in O9-1 cells. Smchd1 expression was induced under high glucose conditions whereas cholesterol synthesis inhibitors decreased Smchd1 expression during chondrogenesis. These data highlight a novel role for cholesterol biosynthesis in cNCC physiology and demonstrate that human phenotypic variability in SMCHD1 mutation carriers may be related, in part, to SMCHD1's sensitivity to glucose or cholesterol dosage during development.</p>

<p><strong>Identification and validation of fatty acid metabolism-related lncRNA signatures as a novel prognostic model for clear cell renal cell carcinoma.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120692/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120692</a></p>
<p>Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a main subtype of renal cancer, and advanced ccRCC frequently has poor prognosis. Many studies have found that lipid metabolism influences tumor development and treatment. This study was to examine the prognostic and functional significance of genes associated with lipid metabolism in individuals with ccRCC. Using the database TCGA, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with fatty acid metabolism (FAM) were identified. Prognostic risk score models for genes related to FAM were created using univariate and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analyses. Our findings demonstrate that the prognosis of patients with ccRCC correlate highly with the profiles of FAM-related lncRNAs (AC009166.1, LINC00605, LINC01615, HOXA-AS2, AC103706.1, AC009686.2, AL590094.1, AC093278.2). The prognostic signature can serve as an independent predictive predictor for patients with ccRCC. The predictive signature's diagnostic effectiveness was superior to individual clinicopathological factors. Between the low- and high-risk groups, immunity research revealed a startling difference in terms of cells, function, and checkpoint scores. Chemotherapeutic medications such lapatinib, AZD8055, and WIKI4 had better outcomes for patients in the high-risk group. Overall, the predictive signature can help with clinical selection of immunotherapeutic regimens and chemotherapeutic drugs, improving prognosis prediction for ccRCC patients.</p>

<p><strong>Synthetic lethality prediction in DNA damage repair, chromatin remodeling and the cell cycle using multi-omics data from cell lines and patients.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120674/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120674</a></p>
<p>Discovering synthetic lethal (SL) gene partners of cancer genes is an important step in developing cancer therapies. However, identification of SL interactions is challenging, due to a large number of possible gene pairs, inherent noise and confounding factors in the observed signal. To discover robust SL interactions, we devised SLIDE-VIP, a novel framework combining eight statistical tests, including a new patient data-based test iSurvLRT. SLIDE-VIP leverages multi-omics data from four different sources: gene inactivation cell line screens, cancer patient data, drug screens and gene pathways. We applied SLIDE-VIP to discover SL interactions between genes involved in DNA damage repair, chromatin remodeling and cell cycle, and their potentially druggable partners. The top 883 ranking SL candidates had strong evidence in cell line and patient data, 250-fold reducing the initial space of 200K pairs. Drug screen and pathway tests provided additional corroboration and insights into these interactions. We rediscovered well-known SL pairs such as RB1 and E2F3 or PRKDC and ATM, and in addition, proposed strong novel SL candidates such as PTEN and PIK3CB. In summary, SLIDE-VIP opens the door to the discovery of SL interactions with clinical potential. All analysis and visualizations are available via the online SLIDE-VIP WebApp.</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120666/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120666</a></p>
<p>Sensitive and reliable identification of proteins and peptides pertains the basis of proteomics. We introduce Mzion, a new database search tool for data-dependent acquisition (DDA) proteomics. Our tool utilizes an intensity tally strategy and achieves generally a higher performance in terms of depth and precision across 20 datasets, ranging from large-scale to single-cell proteomics. Compared to several other search engines, Mzion matches on average 20% more peptide spectra at tryptic enzymatic specificity and 80% more at no enzymatic specificity from six large-scale, global datasets. Mzion also identifies more phosphopeptide spectra that can be explained by fewer proteins, demonstrated by six large-scale, local datasets corresponding to the global data. Our findings highlight the potential of Mzion for improving proteomic analysis and advancing our understanding of protein biology.</p>

<p><strong>Clinical implications of somatic allele expansion in female FMR1 premutation carriers.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120588/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120588</a></p>
<p>Carriers of a premutation allele (PM) in the FMR1 gene are at risk of developing a number of Fragile X premutation asssociated disorders (FXPAC), including Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), Fragile X-associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI), and Fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND). We have recently reported somatic CGG allele expansion in female PM; however, its clinical significance remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the potential clinical association between somatic FMR1 allele instability and PM associated disorders. Participants comprised of 424 female PM carriers age 0.3- 90 years. FMR1 molecular measures and clinical information on the presence of medical conditions, were determined for all subjects for primary analysis. Two sub-groups of participants (age ≥ 25, N = 377 and age ≥ 50, N = 134) were used in the analysis related to presence of FXPOI and FXTAS, respectively. Among all participants (N = 424), the degree of instability (expansion) was significantly higher (median 2.5 vs 2.0, P = 0.026) in participants with a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to those without. FMR1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in subjects with any psychiatric disorder diagnosis (P = 0.0017); specifically, in those with ADHD (P = 0.009), and with depression (P = 0.025). Somatic FMR1 expansion was associated with the presence of ADHD in female PM and FMR1 mRNA levels were associated with the presence of mental health disorders. The findings of our research are innovative as they suggest a potential role of the CGG expansion in the clinical phenotype of PM and may potentially guide clinical prognosis and management.</p>

<p><strong>Prenatal phthalate exposure and cord blood DNA methylation.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120575/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120575</a></p>
<p>Exposure to phthalates has been shown to impede the human endocrine system, resulting in deleterious effects on pregnant women and their children. Phthalates modify DNA methylation patterns in infant cord blood. We examined the association between prenatal phthalate exposure and DNA methylation patterns in cord blood in a Korean birth cohort. Phthalate levels were measured in 274 maternal urine samples obtained during late pregnancy and 102 neonatal urine samples obtained at birth, and DNA methylation levels were measured in cord blood samples. For each infant in the cohort, associations between CpG methylation and both maternal and neonate phthalate levels were analyzed using linear mixed models. The results were combined with those from a meta-analysis of the levels of phthalates in maternal and neonatal urine samples, which were also analyzed for MEOHP, MEHHP, MnBP, and DEHP. This meta-analysis revealed significant associations between the methylation levels of CpG sites near the CHN2 and CUL3 genes, which were also associated with MEOHP and MnBP in neonatal urine. When the data were stratified by the sex of the infant, MnBP concentration was found to be associated with one CpG site near the OR2A2 and MEGF11 genes in female infants. In contrast, the concentrations of the three maternal phthalates showed no significant association with CpG site methylation. Furthermore, the data identified distinct differentially methylated regions in maternal and neonatal urine samples following exposure to phthalates. The CpGs with methylation levels that were positively associated with phthalate levels (particularly MEOHP and MnBP) were found to be enriched genes and related pathways. These results indicate that prenatal phthalate exposure is significantly associated with DNA methylation at multiple CpG sites. These alterations in DNA methylation may serve as biomarkers of maternal exposure to phthalates in infants and are potential candidates for investigating the mechanisms by which phthalates impact maternal and neonatal health.</p>

<p><strong>MMP9 and TYROBP affect the survival of circulating tumor cells in clear cell renal cell carcinoma by adapting to tumor immune microenvironment.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37117633/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37117633</a></p>
<p>Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) play a key role in tumor metastasis. CTCs have altered gene expression and can survive in the bloodstream. Finding the key genes whose expression are altered in CTCs could help explain the mechanism of tumor metastasis. We searched for genes differentially expressed in CTCs by analyzing four CTCs and primary tumor gene expression datasets in the GEO database. Key genes of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) CTCs were identified. The correlation between key genes and the immune microenvironment of ccRCC was explored. Finally, the CTCs cell model of ccRCC was constructed by in vivo screening method, and the expression of key genes was detected at the cell and tissue levels. A total of 771 DEGs were obtained. Gene enrichment analysis showed that DEGs of CTCs were mainly involved in the regulation of the tumor immune process and tumor cell apoptosis. Finally, we found 2 key genes, MMP9 and TYROBP in ccRCC CTCs. The high expression of these 2 genes predicted a poor prognosis of ccRCC, and the expression levels of these 2 genes were significantly increased in CTCs and ccRCC tissues. Our study suggested that genetic alterations in CTCs contribute to the ability of CTCs to survive in the blood by adapting to the tumor microenvironment. MMP9 and TYROBP are potential therapeutic and prognostic targets for ccRCC.</p>

<p>To conduct a systematic review of the comparative efficacy of various psychotropic medications for the treatment of disruptive behavior (DBs) in youths. To this aim, we systematically reviewed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of various psychotropic medications targeting symptoms of DBs and applied network meta-analysis to investigate their relative efficacy. Fifty-five RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria were selected. To predict and interpret relative treatment efficacy, we compared the efficacy of various psychotropic medications prescribed for DB symptoms based on their mechanism of action. Network meta-analysis revealed that for reducing DBs, second-generation antipsychotics, stimulants, and non-stimulant ADHD medications were more efficacious than placebo, and second-generation antipsychotics were the most efficacious. The dopaminergic modulation of top-down inhibitory process by these medications is discussed in this review. This study offers information on the relative efficacy of various psychotropic medications for the treatment of DB, and insight into a potential neurobiological underpinning for those symptoms. It also illustrates the potential utility of these neurobiological mechanisms as a target for future treatment studies.</p>

<p>The acquired drug resistance by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) to antibiotics urges the need for developing novel anti-M. tuberculosis drugs that possess novel mechanism of action. Since traditional drug discovery is a labor-intensive and costly process, computer aided drug design is highly appreciated tool as it speeds up and lower the cost of drug development process. Herein, Asinex antibacterial compounds were virtually screened against thioesterase domain of Polyketide synthase 13, a unique enzyme that forms α-alkyl β-ketoesters as a direct precursor of mycolic acids which are essential components of the lipid-rich cell wall of M. tuberculosis. The study identified three drug-like compounds as the most promising leads; BBB_26582140, BBD_30878599 and BBC_29956160 with binding energy value of - 11.25 kcal/mol, - 9.87 kcal/mol and - 9.33 kcal/mol, respectively. The control molecule binding energy score is -9.25 kcal/mol. Also, the docked complexes were dynamically stable with maximum root mean square deviation (RMSD) value of 3 Å. Similarly, the MM-GB\PBSA method revealed highly stable complexes with mean energy values < - 75 kcal/mol for all three systems. The net binding energy scores are validated by WaterSwap and entropy energy analysis. Furthermore, The in silico druglike and pharmacokinetic investigation revealed that the compounds could be suitable candidates for additional experimentations. In summary, the study findings are significant, and the compounds may be used in experimental validation pipeline to develop potential drugs against drug-resistant tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Multisite collection and preservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for centralized analysis is an indispensable strategy for large cohort immune phenotyping studies. However, the absence of cross-site standardized protocols introduces unnecessary sample variance. Here we describe the protocol implemented by the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Disorders (POND) Network's immune platform for the multisite collection, processing, and cryopreservation of PBMCs. We outline quality control standards and evaluate the performance of our PBMC processing and storage protocol. We also describe the Child Immune History Questionnaire results, an assessment tool evaluating pre-existing immune conditions in children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Cell viability was assessed in samples from 178 participants based on strict quality control criteria. Overall, 83.1% of samples passed quality control standards. Samples collected and processed at the same site had higher quality control pass rates than samples that were collected and subsequently shipped to another site for processing. We investigated if freezer time impacted sample viability and found no difference in mean freezer time between samples that passed and failed quality control. The Child Immune History Questionnaire had a response rate of 87.1%. The described protocol produces viable samples that may be used in future immune phenotyping experiments.</p>

<p><strong>A game theoretic approach to balance privacy risks and familial benefits.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37117219/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37117219</a></p>
<p>As recreational genomics continues to grow in its popularity, many people are afforded the opportunity to share their genomes in exchange for various services, including third-party interpretation (TPI) tools, to understand their predisposition to health problems and, based on genome similarity, to find extended family members. At the same time, these services have increasingly been reused by law enforcement to track down potential criminals through family members who disclose their genomic information. While it has been observed that many potential users shy away from such data sharing when they learn that their privacy cannot be assured, it remains unclear how potential users' valuations of the service will affect a population's behavior. In this paper, we present a game theoretic framework to model interdependent privacy challenges in genomic data sharing online. Through simulations, we find that in addition to the boundary cases when (1) no player and (2) every player joins, there exist pure-strategy Nash equilibria when a relatively small portion of players choose to join the genomic database. The result is consistent under different parametric settings. We further examine the stability of Nash equilibria and illustrate that the only equilibrium that is resistant to a random dropping of players is when all players join the genomic database. Finally, we show that when players consider the impact that their data sharing may have on their relatives, the only pure strategy Nash equilibria are when either no player or every player shares their genomic data.</p>

<p>Two slightly lithified volcanic rich layers (VRL) (former tephra) SVT-2 (San Vittorino) and CAC (Castiglione a Casauria) were sampled from two distinct post-evaporitic Messinian stratigraphic sections (Abruzzo, Central Italy). They crop only few tens of km apart and are predominantly massive, although some specimens show sedimentary structures. Both VRLs were investigated for the first time by field, mesoscopic, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), transmission optical microscopy (TOM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), bulk composition, electron-microprobe analysis (EMPA) and quantitative textural attributes by image analysis. The XRPD analysis detects the presence of a glass phase, plus few (< 2 area %) magmatic-like feldspars, clinopyroxene and biotite and stratigraphically variable sedimentary minerals such as calcite, dolomite, illite and montmorillonite (from 0 to 40 area %). The 2D image analysis performed on SEM microphotographs reveals that both sections are composed of very fine glass shards, magmatic minerals are never isolated, whilst the carbonate crystals mainly fill voids among volcanic particles. Both these VRLs have identical rhyolitic glass compositions that closely overlap with those of previously-studied coeval and stratigraphically related sections occurring in the northern Apennine region and dated as 5.5 Ma.

<p>Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to be a comprehensive genetic test, especially relevant for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, syndromes and congenital malformations. However, the cost consequences of using whole genome sequencing as a first-line genetic test for these individuals are not well understood. The study objective was to compare the healthcare costs and diagnostic yield when WGS is performed as the first-line test instead of chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). Two cohorts were analyzed retrospectively using register data, cohort CMA (418 patients referred for CMA at the department of Clinical Genetics, Karolinska University Hospital, during 2015) and cohort WGS (89 patients included in a WGS-first prospective study in 2017). The analysis compared healthcare consumption over a 2-year period after referral for genetic testing, the diagnostic yield over a 2- and 3-year period after referral was also compiled. The mean healthcare cost per patient in cohort WGS was $2,339 lower compared to cohort CMA ($ - 2339, 95% CI - 12,238-7561; P = 0.64) including higher costs for genetic investigations ($1065, 95% CI 834-1295; P < 0.001) and lower costs for outpatient care ($ - 2330, 95% CI - 3992 to (- 669); P = 0.006). The diagnostic yield was 23% higher for cohort WGS (cohort CMA 20.1%, cohort WGS 24.7%) (0.046, 95% CI - 0.053-0.145; P = 0.36). WGS as a first-line diagnostic test for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders is associated with statistically non-significant lower costs and higher diagnostic yield compared with CMA. This indicates that prioritizing WGS over CMA in health care decision making will yield positive expected outcomes as well as showing a need for further research.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized as a distinct onset and progression of cognitive and functional decline associated with age, as well as a specific neuropathology. It has been discovered that glutamine (Gln) metabolism plays a crucial role in cancer. However, a full investigation of its role in Alzheimer's disease is still missing. This study intended to find and confirm potential Gln-related genes associated with AD using bioinformatics analysis. The discovery of GlnMgs was made possible by the intersection of the WGCNA test and 26 Gln-metabolism genes (GlnMgs). GlnMgs' putative biological functions and pathways were identified using GSVA. The LASSO method was then used to identify the hub genes as well as the diagnostic efficiency of the four GlnMgs in identifying AD. The association between hub GlnMgs and clinical characteristics was also studied. Finally, the GSE63060 was utilized to confirm the levels of expression of the four GlnMgs. Four GlnMgs were discovered (ATP5H, NDUFAB1, PFN2, and SPHKAP). For biological function analysis, cell fate specification, atrioventricular canal development, and neuron fate specification were emphasized. The diagnostic ability of the four GlnMgs in differentiating AD exhibited a good value. This study discovered four GlnMgs that are linked to AD. They shed light on potential new biomarkers for AD and tracking its progression.</p>

<p><strong>Generalizability of 3D CNN models for age estimation in diverse youth populations using structural MRI.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37106035/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37106035</a></p>
<p>Recently, several studies have investigated the neurodevelopment of psychiatric disorders using brain data acquired via structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). These analyses have shown the potential of sMRI data to provide a relatively precise characterization of brain structural biomarkers. Despite these advances, a relatively unexplored question is how reliable and consistent a model is when assessing subjects from other independent datasets. In this study, we investigate the performance and generalizability of the same model architecture trained from distinct datasets comprising youths in diverse stages of neurodevelopment and with different mental health conditions. We employed models with the same 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to assess autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), brain age, and a measure of dimensional psychopathology, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) total score. The investigated datasets include the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II (ABIDE-II, N = 580), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD-200, N = 922), Brazilian High-Risk Cohort Study (BHRCS, N = 737), and Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD, N = 11,031). Models' performance and interpretability were assessed within each dataset (for diagnosis tasks) and inter-datasets (for age estimation). Despite the demographic and phenotypic differences of the subjects, all models presented significant estimations for age (p value < 0.001) within and between datasets. In addition, most models showed a moderate to high correlation in age estimation. The results, including the models' brain regions of interest (ROI), were analyzed and discussed in light of the youth neurodevelopmental structural changes. Among other interesting discoveries, we found that less confounded training datasets produce models with higher generalization capacity.</p>

<p><strong>Thermodynamic determination of the equilibrium first-order phase-transition line hidden by hysteresis in a phase diagram.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37106004/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37106004</a></p>
<p>In some materials exhibiting field-induced first-order transitions (FOTs), the equilibrium phase-transition line is hidden by the hysteresis region associated with the FOT. In general, phase diagrams form the basis for the study of material science, and the profiles of phase-transition lines separating different thermodynamic phases include comprehensive information about thermodynamic quantities, such as latent heat. However, in a field-induced FOT, the equilibrium phase-transition line cannot be precisely determined from measurements of resistivity, magnetization, etc, especially when the transition is accompanied by large hysteresis. Here, we demonstrate a thermodynamics-based method for determining the hidden equilibrium FOT line in a material exhibiting a field-induced FOT. This method is verified for the field-induced FOT between antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic states in magneto-electric compounds ([Formula: see text]. The equilibrium FOT line determined based on the Clausius-Clapeyron equation exhibits a reasonable profile in terms of the third law of thermodynamics, and it shows marked differences from the midpoints of the hysteresis region. Our findings highlight that for a field-induced FOT exhibiting large hysteresis, care should be taken for referring to the hysteresis midpoint line when discussing field-induced latent heat or magnetocaloric effects.</p>

<p>Social skills training (SST), which is a rehabilitation program for improving daily interpersonal communication, has been used for more than 40 years. Although such training's demand is increasing, its accessibility is limited due to the lack of experienced trainers. To tackle this issue, automated SST systems have been studied for years. An evaluation-feedback pipeline of social skills is a crucial component of an SST system. Unfortunately, research that considers both the evaluation and feedback parts of automation remains insufficient. In this paper, we collected and analyzed the characteristics of a human-human SST dataset that consisted of 19 healthy controls, 15 schizophreniacs, 16 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) participants, and 276 sessions with score labels of six clinical measures. From our analysis of this dataset, we developed an automated SST evaluation-feedback system under the supervision of professional, experienced SST trainers. We identified their preferred or most acceptable feedback methods by running a user-study on the following conditions: with/without recorded video of the role-plays of users and different amounts of positive and corrective feedback. We confirmed a reasonable performance of our social-skill-score estimation models as our system's evaluation part with a maximum Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.68. For the feedback part, our user-study concluded that people understood more about what aspects they need to improve by watching recorded videos of their own performance. In terms of the amount of feedback, participants most preferred a 2-positive/1-corrective format. Since the average amount of feedback preferred by the participants nearly equaled that from experienced trainers in human-human SSTs, our result suggests the practical future possibilities of an automated evaluation-feedback system that complements SSTs done by professional trainers.</p>

<p><strong>Identification of oxidative stress-related genes differentially expressed in Alzheimer's disease and construction of a hub gene-based diagnostic model.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37100862/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37100862</a></p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent dementia disorder globally, and there are still no effective interventions for slowing or stopping the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. There is strong evidence implicating neural oxidative stress (OS) and ensuing neuroinflammation in the progressive neurodegeneration observed in the AD brain both during and prior to symptom emergence. Thus, OS-related biomarkers may be valuable for prognosis and provide clues to therapeutic targets during the early presymptomatic phase. In the current study, we gathered brain RNA-seq data of AD patients and matched controls from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to identify differentially expressed OS-related genes (OSRGs). These OSRGs were analyzed for cellular functions using the Gene Ontology (GO) database and used to construct a weighted gene co-expression network (WGCN) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were then constructed to identify network hub genes. A diagnostic model was established based on these hub genes using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and ROC analyses. Immune-related functions were examined by assessing correlations between hub gene expression and immune cell brain infiltration scores. Further, target drugs were predicted using the Drug-Gene Interaction database, while regulatory miRNAs and transcription factors were predicted using miRNet. In total, 156 candidate genes were identified among 11046 differentially expressed genes, 7098 genes in WGCN modules, and 446 OSRGs, and 5 hub genes (MAPK9, FOXO1, BCL2, ETS1, and SP1) were identified by ROC curve analyses. These hub genes were enriched in GO annotations "Alzheimer's disease pathway," "Parkinson's Disease," "Ribosome," and "Chronic myeloid leukemia." In addition, 78 drugs were predicted to target FOXO1, SP1, MAPK9, and BCL2, including fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and epirubicin. A hub gene-miRNA regulatory network with 43 miRNAs and hub gene-transcription factor (TF) network with 36 TFs were also generated. These hub genes may serve as biomarkers for AD diagnosis and provide clues to novel potential treatment targets.</p>

<p>Chemical-induced dysregulation of DNA methylation during the fetal period is known to contribute to developmental disorders or increase the risk of certain diseases later in life. In this study, we developed an iGEM (iPS cell-based global epigenetic modulation) detection assay using human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells that express a fluorescently labeled methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD), which enables a high-throughput screening of epigenetic teratogens/mutagens. 135 chemicals with known cardiotoxicity and carcinogenicity were categorized according to the MBD signal intensity, which reflects the degree of nuclear spatial distribution/concentration of DNA methylation. Further biological characterization through machine-learning analysis that integrated genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression profiling, and knowledge-based pathway analysis revealed that chemicals with hyperactive MBD signals strongly associated their effects on DNA methylation and expression of genes involved in cell cycle and development. These results demonstrated that our MBD-based integrated analytical system is a powerful framework for detecting epigenetic compounds and providing mechanism insights of pharmaceutical development for sustainable human health.</p>

<p><strong>Validation of subjective manual palpation using objective physiological recordings of the cranial rhythmic impulse during osteopathic manipulative intervention.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37095164/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37095164</a></p>
<p>Intermediate (IM) band physiology in skin blood flow exhibits parallels with the primary respiratory mechanism (PRM) or cranial rhythmic impulse (CRI), controversial concepts of osteopathy in the cranial field (OCF). Owing to inconsistent manual palpation results, validity of evidence of PRM/CRI activity has been questionable. We therefore tried to validate manual palpation combining instrumented tracking and algorithmic objectivation of frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. Using a standard OCF intervention, cranial vault hold (CVH), two OCF experts palpated and digitally marked CRI frequencies in 25 healthy adults. Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity in low frequency (LF) and IM band in photoplethysmographic (PPG) forehead skin recordings was probed with momentary frequency of highest amplitude (MFHA) and wavelet amplitude spectra (WAS) in examiners and participants. Palpation errors and frequency expectation bias during CVH were analyzed for phases of MFHA and CRI. Palpated CRI frequencies (0.05-0.08 Hz) correlated highly with mean MFHA frequencies with 1:1 ratio in 77% of participants (LF-responders; 0.072 Hz) and with 2:1 ratio in 23% of participants (IM-responders; 0.147 Hz). WAS analysis in both groups revealed integer number (harmonic) waves in (very) low and IM bands in > 98% of palpated intervals. Phase analyses in participants and examiners suggested synchronization between MFHA and CRI in a subset of LF-responders. IM band physiology in forehead PPG may offer a sensible physiological correlate of palpated CRI activity. Possible coordination or synchronization effects with additional physiological signals and between examiners and participants should be investigated in future studies.</p>

<p>Recently, several probiotic products have been developed; however, most probiotic applications focused on prokaryotic bacteria whereas eukaryotic probiotics have received little attention. Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains are eukaryotes notable for their fermentation and functional food applications. The present study investigated the novel yeast strains isolated from Korean fermented beverages and examined their potential probiotic characteristics. We investigated seven strains among 100 isolates with probiotic characteristics further. The strains have capabilities such as auto-aggregation tendency, co-aggregation with a pathogen, hydrophobicity with n-hexadecane,1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl scavenging effect, survival in simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions and the adhesion ability of the strains to the Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, all the strains contained high cell wall glucan content, a polysaccharide with immunological effects. Internal transcribed spacer sequencing identified the Saccharomyces strains selected in the present study as probiotics. To examine the effects of alleviating inflammation in cells, nitric oxide generation in raw 264.7 cells with S. cerevisiae showed that S. cerevisiae GILA could be a potential probiotic strain able to alleviate inflammation. Three probiotics of S. cerevisiae GILA strains were chosen by in vivo screening with a dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis murine model. In particular, GILA 118 down-regulates neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and myeloperoxidase in mice treated with DSS. The expression levels of genes encoding tight junction proteins in the colon were upregulated, cytokine interleukin-10 was significantly increased, and tumor necrosis factor-α was reduced in the serum.</p>

<p>Peri-hilar cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA) is chemorefractory and limited genomic analyses have been undertaken in Western idiopathic disease. We undertook comprehensive genomic analyses of a U.K. idiopathic pCCA cohort to characterize its mutational profile and identify new targets. Whole exome and targeted DNA sequencing was performed on forty-two resected pCCA tumors and normal bile ducts, with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using one-tailed testing to generate false discovery rates (FDR). 60% of patients harbored one cancer-associated mutation, with two mutations in 20%. High frequency somatic mutations in genes not typically associated with cholangiocarcinoma included mTOR, ABL1 and NOTCH1. We identified non-synonymous mutation (p.Glu38del) in MAP3K9 in ten tumors, associated with increased peri-vascular invasion (Fisher's exact, p < 0.018). Mutation-enriched pathways were primarily immunological, including innate Dectin-2 (FDR 0.001) and adaptive T-cell receptor pathways including PD-1 (FDR 0.007), CD4 phosphorylation (FDR 0.009) and ZAP70 translocation (FDR 0.009), with overlapping HLA genes. We observed cancer-associated mutations in over half of our patients. Many of these mutations are not typically associated with cholangiocarcinoma yet may increase eligibility for contemporary targeted trials. We also identified a targetable MAP3K9 mutation, in addition to oncogenic and immunological pathways hitherto not described in any cholangiocarcinoma subtype.</p>

<p>For detecting field carcinogenesis non-invasively, early technical development and case-control testing of exhaled breath condensate microRNAs was performed. In design, human lung tissue microRNA-seq discovery was reconciled with TCGA and published tumor-discriminant microRNAs, yielding a panel of 24 upregulated microRNAs. The airway origin of exhaled microRNAs was topographically "fingerprinted", using paired EBC, upper and lower airway donor sample sets. A clinic-based case-control study (166 NSCLC cases, 185 controls) was interrogated with the microRNA panel by qualitative RT-PCR. Data were analyzed by logistic regression (LR), and by random-forest (RF) models. Feasibility testing of exhaled microRNA detection, including optimized whole EBC extraction, and RT and qualitative PCR method evaluation, was performed. For sensitivity in this low template setting, intercalating dye-based URT-PCR was superior to fluorescent probe-based PCR (TaqMan). In application, adjusted logistic regression models identified exhaled miR-21, 33b, 212 as overall case-control discriminant. RF analysis of combined clinical + microRNA models showed modest added discrimination capacity (1.1-2.5%) beyond clinical models alone: all subjects 1.1% (p = 8.7e-04)); former smokers 2.5% (p = 3.6e-05); early stage 1.2% (p = 9.0e-03), yielding combined ROC AUC ranging from 0.74 to 0.83. We conclude that exhaled microRNAs are qualitatively measureable, reflect in part lower airway signatures; and when further refined/quantitated, can potentially help to improve lung cancer risk assessment.</p>

<p>The world's population is projected to grow 32% in the coming years, and the number of Muslims is expected to grow by 70%-from 1.8 billion in 2015 to about 3 billion in 2060. Hijri is the Islamic calendar, also known as the lunar Hijri calendar, which consists of 12 lunar months, and it is tied to the Moon phases where a new crescent Moon marks the beginning of each month. Muslims use the Hijri calendar to determine important dates and religious events such as Ramadan, Haj, Muharram, etc. Till today, there is no consensus on deciding on the beginning of Ramadan month within the Muslim community. This is mainly due to the imprecise observations of the new crescent Moon in different locations. Artificial intelligence and its sub-field machine learning have shown great success in their application in several fields. In this paper, we propose the use of machine learning algorithms to help in determining the start of Ramadan month by predicting the visibility of the new crescent Moon. The results obtained from our experiments have shown very good accurate prediction and evaluation performance. The Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers have provided promising results compared to other classifiers considered in this study in predicting the visibility of the new Moon.</p>

<p>The ligand-receptor interaction is fundamental to many cellular processes in eukaryotic cells such as cell migration, proliferation, adhesion, signaling and so on. Cell migration is a central process in the development of organisms. Receptor induced chemo-tactic sensitivity plays an important role in cell migration. However, recently some receptors identified as decoy receptors, obstruct some mechanisms of certain regular receptors. DcR3 is one such important decoy receptor, generally found in glioma cell, RCC cell and many various malignant cells which obstruct some mechanism including apoptosis cell-signaling, cell inflammation, cell migration. The goal of our work is to mathematically formulate ligand-receptor interaction induced cell migration in the presence of decoy receptors. We develop here a novel mathematical model, consisting of four coupled partial differential equations which predict the movement of glioma cells due to the reaction-kinetic mechanism between regular receptors CD95, its ligand CD95L and decoy receptors DcR3 as obtained in experimental results. The aim is to measure the number of cells in the chamber's filter for different concentrations of ligand in presence of decoy receptors and compute the distance travelled by the cells inside filter due to cell migration. Using experimental results, we validate our model which suggests that the concentration of ligands plays an important role in cell migration.</p>

<p>Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) has been used successfully over the years to investigate the peripheral nervous system (PNS) because it allows early detection and precise localisation of neural tissue damage. However, studies demonstrating the feasibility of combining MRN with multi-parametric quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) methods, which provide more specific information related to nerve tissue composition and microstructural organisation, can be invaluable. The translation of emerging qMRI methods previously validated in the central nervous system to the PNS offers real potential to characterise in patients in vivo the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involved in a plethora of conditions of the PNS. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of combining MRN with qMRI to measure diffusion, magnetisation transfer and relaxation properties of the healthy sciatic nerve in vivo using a unified signal readout protocol. The reproducibility of the multi-parametric qMRI protocol as well as normative qMRI measures in the healthy sciatic nerve are reported. The findings presented herein pave the way to the practical implementation of joint MRN-qMRI in future studies of pathological conditions affecting the PNS.</p>

The intrahippocampal kainic acid model of temporal lobe epilepsy is an appropriate rodent model to evaluate the effects of novel interventions, including glycolysis inhibition, on epilepsy-induced alterations. Here, we investigated kainic acid-induced changes in the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) circuit and the efficiency of a glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxy D-glucose (2-DG), in resetting such alterations using simultaneous local field potentials (LFP) recording and elevated zero-maze test. dHPC theta and gamma powers were lower in epileptic groups, both in the baseline and anxiogenic conditions. BLA theta power was higher in baseline condition while it was lower in anxiogenic condition in epileptic animals and 2-DG could reverse it. dHPC-BLA coherence was altered only in anxiogenic condition and 2-DG could reverse it only in gamma frequency. This coherence was significantly correlated with the time in which the animals exposed themselves to the anxiogenic condition. Further, theta-gamma phase-locking was lower in epileptic groups in the dHPC-BLA circuit and 2-DG could considerably increase it.</p>

<p>Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is an autoinflammatory bone disorder. The origin and development of CNO involve many complex immune processes, resulting in delayed diagnosis and a lack of effective treatment. Although bioinformatics analysis has been utilized to seek key genes and pathways in CNO, only a few bioinformatics studies that focus on CNO pathogenesis and mechanisms have been reported. This study aimed to identify key biomarkers that could serve as early diagnostic or therapeutic markers for CNO. Two RNA-seq datasets (GSE133378 and GSE187429) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis were conducted to identify the genes associated with CNO. Then, the autoinflammatory genes most associated with CNO were identified based on the GeneCards database and a CNO prediction model, which was created by the LASSO machine learning algorithm. The accuracy of the model and effects of the autoinflammatory genes according to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were verified in external datasets (GSE7014). Finally, we performed clustering analysis with ConsensusClusterPlus. In total, eighty CNO-related genes were identified and were significantly enriched in the biological processes regulation of actin filament organization, cell-cell junction organization and gamma-catenin binding. The main enriched pathways were adherens junctions, viral carcinogenesis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Two autoinflammatory genes with high expression in CNO samples were identified by combining an optimal machine learning algorithm (LASSO) with the GeneCards database. An external validation dataset (GSE187429) was utilized for ROC analysis of the prediction model and two genes, and the results indicated good efficiency. Then, based on consensus clustering analysis, we found that the expression of UTS2 and MPO differed between clusters. Finally, the ceRNA network of lncRNAs and the small molecule compounds targeting the two autoinflammatory genes were predicted. The identification of two autoinflammatory genes, the HCG18/has-mir-147a/UTS2/MPO axis and signalling pathways in this study can help us understand the molecular mechanism of CNO formation and provides candidate targets for the diagnosis and treatment of CNO.</p>

<p>In advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), response to immunotherapy is difficult to predict from pre-treatment information. Given the toxicity of immunotherapy and its financial burden on the healthcare system, we set out to identify patients for whom treatment is effective. To this end, we used mutational signatures from DNA mutations in pre-treatment tissue. Single base substitutions, doublet base substitutions, indels, and copy number alteration signatures were analysed in [Formula: see text] patients (the discovery set). We found that tobacco smoking signature (SBS4) and thiopurine chemotherapy exposure-associated signature (SBS87) were linked to durable benefit. Combining both signatures in a machine learning model separated patients with a progression-free survival hazard ratio of 0.40[Formula: see text] on the cross-validated discovery set and 0.24[Formula: see text] on an independent external validation set ([Formula: see text]). This paper demonstrates that the fingerprints of mutagenesis, codified through mutational signatures, select advanced NSCLC patients who may benefit from immunotherapy, thus potentially reducing unnecessary patient burden.</p>

Critical to the management toolkit is a comprehensive genomic resource for these insects. Here we provide the annotated genomes for two hornets, Vespa crabro and Vespa velutina. We compare their genomes with those of other social Hymenoptera, including the northern giant hornet Vespa mandarinia. The three hornet genomes show evidence of selection pressure on genes associated with reproduction, which might facilitate the transition into invasive ranges. Vespa crabro has experienced positive selection on the highest number of genes, including those putatively associated with molecular binding and olfactory systems. Caste-specific brain transcriptomic analysis also revealed 133 differentially expressed genes, some of which are associated with olfactory functions. This report provides a spring-board for advancing our understanding of the evolution and ecology of hornets, and opens up opportunities for using molecular methods in the future management of both native and invasive populations of these over-looked insects.</p>

<p><strong>Extended perceptive field revealed in humans with binocular fusion disorders.</strong></p>

<p>Binocular vision disorders or dysfunctions have considerable impact on daily visual activities such as reading. Heterophoria (phoria) is a latent eye misalignment (with a prevalence of up to 35%) that appears in conditions that disrupt binocular vision and it may affect the quality of binocular fusion. Our recent study, which used lateral masking (LM), suggests that subjects with binocular fusion disorders (horizontal phoria) exhibit an asymmetry and an abnormal pattern of both binocular and monocular lateral interactions, but only for the horizontal meridian (HM). The perceptive field (PF) is the fundamental processing unit of human vision and both masking and crowding depend on its size. An increased PF size is found in amblyopic populations or in young children. We hypothesized that the PF's size would be asymmetric only for the phoric group (larger along the HM). We estimated the PF's size using two different methods (LM with equal-phase and opposite-phase flankers). Phoric subjects exhibited a larger binocular PF size, only for the HM, confirming our hypothesis of an asymmetric PF size. However, the monocular PF size of phoric and control subjects was similar. Phoria affects the PF's size similarly to meridional amblyopia but without being attributed to abnormal refraction. We suggest that these findings could help explain the inter-observer variability found in the masking literature and the reading difficulties often encountered in subjects with high heterophoria. Since perceptual learning can reduce the PF's size, further investigation of training may provide a novel therapy to reduce some symptoms related to heterophoria.</p>

<p>Providing an accurate prognosis for individual dementia patients remains a challenge since they greatly differ in rates of cognitive decline. In this study, we used machine learning techniques with the aim to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers that predict the rate of cognitive decline within dementia patients. First, longitudinal mini-mental state examination scores (MMSE) of 210 dementia patients were used to create fast and slow progression groups. Second, we trained random forest classifiers on CSF proteomic profiles and obtained a well-performing prediction model for the progression group (ROC-AUC = 0.82). As a third step, Shapley values and Gini feature importance measures were used to interpret the model performance and identify top biomarker candidates for predicting the rate of cognitive decline. Finally, we explored the potential for each of the 20 top candidates in internal sensitivity analyses. TNFRSF4 and TGF [Formula: see text]-1 emerged as the top markers, being lower in fast-progressing patients compared to slow-progressing patients. Proteins of which a low concentration was associated with fast progression were enriched for cell signalling and immune response pathways. None of our top markers stood out as strong individual predictors of subsequent cognitive decline. This could be explained by small effect sizes per protein and biological heterogeneity among dementia patients. Taken together, this study presents a novel progression biomarker identification framework and protein leads for personalised prediction of cognitive decline in dementia.</p>

Here, we investigate whether mutation-dependent differences in LRRK2 cellular localization could explain this discrepancy.

<p>Apatinib has been shown to clinically enhance anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, the complexity of GC immunosuppression remains a challenge for precision immunotherapy. Here, we profile the transcriptomes of 34,182 single cells from GC patient-derived xenografts of humanized mouse models treated with vehicle, nivolumab, or nivolumab plus apatinib. Notably, excessive expression of CXCL5 in the CellCycle malignant epithelium, induced by anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and blocked by combined apatinib treatment, is found to be a key driver of tumor-associated neutrophil (TAN) recruitment in the tumor microenvironment through the CXCL5/CXCR2 axis. We further show that the protumor TAN signature is associated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy-related progressive disease and poor cancer prognosis. Molecular and functional analyses in cell-derived xenograft models confirm the positive in vivo therapeutic effect of targeting the CXCL5/CXCR2 axis during anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Altogether, our study elucidates the GC immunosuppressive landscape in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and highlights potential targets for overcoming checkpoint immunotherapy resistance.</p>

<p>Most cell types in multicellular organisms can perform multiple functions. However, not all functions can be optimally performed simultaneously by the same cells. Functions incompatible at the level of individual cells can be performed at the cell population level, where cells divide labor and specialize in different functions. Division of labor can arise due to instruction by tissue environment or through self-organization. Here, we develop a computational framework to investigate the contribution of these mechanisms to division of labor within a cell-type population. By optimizing collective cellular task performance under trade-offs, we find that distinguishable expression patterns can emerge from cell-cell interactions versus instructive signals. We propose a method to construct ligand-receptor networks between specialist cells and use it to infer division-of-labor mechanisms from single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics data of stromal, epithelial, and immune cells. Our framework can be used to characterize the complexity of cell interactions within tissues.</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37126723/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37126723</a></p>
<p>Single-cell proteomics has emerged as a powerful method to characterize cellular phenotypic heterogeneity and the cell-specific functional networks underlying biological processes. However, significant challenges remain in single-cell proteomics for the analysis of proteoforms arising from genetic mutations, alternative splicing, and post-translational modifications. Herein, we have developed a highly sensitive functionally integrated top-down proteomics method for the comprehensive analysis of proteoforms from single cells. We applied this method to single muscle fibers (SMFs) to resolve their heterogeneous functional and proteomic properties at the single-cell level. Notably, we have detected single-cell heterogeneity in large proteoforms (>200 kDa) from the SMFs. Using SMFs obtained from three functionally distinct muscles, we found fiber-to-fiber heterogeneity among the sarcomeric proteoforms which can be related to the functional heterogeneity. Importantly, we detected multiple isoforms of myosin heavy chain (~223 kDa), a motor protein that drives muscle contraction, with high reproducibility to enable the classification of individual fiber types. This study reveals single muscle cell heterogeneity in large proteoforms and establishes a direct relationship between sarcomeric proteoforms and muscle fiber types, highlighting the potential of top-down proteomics for uncovering the molecular underpinnings of cell-to-cell variation in complex systems.</p>

<p>Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are one of the largest families of transcription factor (TF) in eukaryotes, and ~30% of all flowering plants' bHLH TFs contain the aspartate kinase, chorismate mutase, and TyrA (ACT)-like domain at variable distances C-terminal from the bHLH. However, the evolutionary history and functional consequences of the bHLH/ACT-like domain association remain unknown. Here, we show that this domain association is unique to the plantae kingdom with green algae (chlorophytes) harboring a small number of bHLH genes with variable frequency of ACT-like domain's presence. bHLH-associated ACT-like domains form a monophyletic group, indicating a common origin. Indeed, phylogenetic analysis results suggest that the association of ACT-like and bHLH domains occurred early in Plantae by recruitment of an ACT-like domain in a common ancestor with widely distributed </p>

<p>Oxidative stress is a key feature in both chronic inflammation and cancer. P38 regulated/activated protein kinase (PRAK) deficiency can cause functional disorders in neutrophils and macrophages under high oxidative stress, but the precise mechanisms by which PRAK regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination and its potential impact on CD4+ T helper subset function are unclear. The present study reveals that the PRAK-NF-E2-related factor 2(NRF2) axis is essential for maintaining the intracellular redox homeostasis of T helper 17(Th17) cells, thereby promoting Th17 cell differentiation and antitumor effects. Through mechanistic analysis, we identify NRF2 as a novel protein substrate of PRAK and find that PRAK enhances the stability of the NRF2 protein through phosphorylation NRF2 Serine(S) 558 independent of protein ubiquitination. High accumulation of cellular ROS caused by loss of PRAK disrupts both glycolysis and PKM2-dependent phosphorylation of STAT3, which subsequently impairs the differentiation of Th17 cells.

<p><strong>Founder personality and entrepreneurial outcomes: A large-scale field study of technology startups.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37126710/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37126710</a></p>
<p>Technology startups play an essential role in the economy-with seven of the ten largest companies rooted in technology, and venture capital investments totaling approximately $300B annually. Yet, important startup outcomes (e.g., whether a startup raises venture capital or gets acquired) remain difficult to forecast-particularly during the early stages of venture formation. Here, we examine the impact of an essential, yet underexplored, factor that can be observed from the moment of startup creation: founder personality. We predict psychological traits from digital footprints to explore how founder personality is associated with critical startup milestones. Observing 10,541 founder-startup dyads, we provide large-scale, ecologically valid evidence that founder personality is associated with outcomes across all phases of a venture's life (i.e., from raising the earliest funding round to exiting via acquisition or initial public offering). We find that openness and agreeableness are positively related to the likelihood of raising an initial round of funding (but unrelated to all subsequent conditional outcomes). Neuroticism is negatively related to all outcomes, highlighting the importance of founders' resilience. Finally, conscientiousness is positively related to early-stage investment, but negatively related to exit conditional on funding. While prior work has painted conscientiousness as a major benefactor of performance, our findings highlight a potential boundary condition: The fast-moving world of technology startups affords founders with lower or moderate levels of conscientiousness a competitive advantage when it comes to monetizing their business via acquisition or IPO.</p>

<p>Cellular sensing of most environmental cues involves receptors that affect a signal-transduction excitable network (STEN), which is coupled to a cytoskeletal excitable network (CEN). We show that the mechanism of sensing of nanoridges is fundamentally different. CEN activity occurs preferentially on nanoridges, whereas STEN activity is constrained between nanoridges. In the absence of STEN, waves disappear, but long-lasting F-actin puncta persist along the ridges. When CEN is suppressed, wave propagation is no longer constrained by nanoridges. A computational model reproduces these experimental observations. Our findings indicate that nanotopography is sensed directly by CEN, whereas STEN is only indirectly affected due to a CEN-STEN feedback loop. These results explain why texture sensing is robust and acts cooperatively with multiple other guidance cues in complex, in vivo microenvironments.</p>

<p>The prognosis and treatment outcomes of heart failure (HF) patients rely heavily on disease etiology, yet the majority of underlying signaling mechanisms are complex and not fully elucidated. Phosphorylation is a major point of protein regulation with rapid and profound effects on the function and activity of protein networks. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive proteomic and phosphoproteomic studies examining cardiac tissue from HF patients with either dilated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). Here, we used a combined proteomic and phosphoproteomic approach to identify and quantify more than 5,000 total proteins with greater than 13,000 corresponding phosphorylation sites across explanted left ventricle (LV) tissue samples, including HF patients with DCM vs. nonfailing controls (NFC), and left ventricular infarct vs. noninfarct, and periinfarct vs. noninfarct regions of HF patients with ICM. Each pair-wise comparison revealed unique global proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles with both shared and etiology-specific perturbations. With this approach, we identified a DCM-associated hyperphosphorylation cluster in the cardiomyocyte intercalated disc (ICD) protein, αT-catenin (CTNNA3). We demonstrate using both ex vivo isolated cardiomyocytes and in vivo using an AAV9-mediated overexpression mouse model, that CTNNA3 phosphorylation at these residues plays a key role in maintaining protein localization at the cardiomyocyte ICD to regulate conductance and cell-cell adhesion. Collectively, this integrative proteomic/phosphoproteomic approach identifies region- and etiology-associated signaling pathways in human HF and describes a role for CTNNA3 phosphorylation in the pathophysiology of DCM.</p>

Little guidance exists for the rapid, representative, and unbiased collection of policy-relevant scientific input from independent modeling teams. Integrating approaches from decision analysis, expert judgment, and model aggregation, we convened multiple modeling teams to evaluate COVID-19 reopening strategies for a mid-sized United States county early in the pandemic. Projections from seventeen distinct models were inconsistent in magnitude but highly consistent in ranking interventions. The 6-mo-ahead aggregate projections were well in line with observed outbreaks in mid-sized US counties. The aggregate results showed that up to half the population could be infected with full workplace reopening, while workplace restrictions reduced median cumulative infections by 82%. Rankings of interventions were consistent across public health objectives, but there was a strong trade-off between public health outcomes and duration of workplace closures, and no win-win intermediate reopening strategies were identified. Between-model variation was high; the aggregate results thus provide valuable risk quantification for decision making. This approach can be applied to the evaluation of management interventions in any setting where models are used to inform decision making. This case study demonstrated the utility of our approach and was one of several multimodel efforts that laid the groundwork for the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, which has provided multiple rounds of real-time scenario projections for situational awareness and decision making to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since December 2020.</p>

Here, we provide a partial least squares regression (PLSR) machine learning approach that uses plasma-derived metabolomics data in one or more samples to estimate dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) as a proxy for circadian phase of the human body. For this purpose, our protocol was aimed to stay close to real-life conditions. We found that a metabolomics approach optimized for either women or men under entrained conditions performed equally well or better than existing approaches using more labor-intensive RNA sequencing-based methods. Although estimation of circadian body time using blood-targeted metabolomics requires further validation in shift work and other real-world conditions, it currently may offer a robust, feasible technique with relatively high accuracy to aid personalized optimization of behavior and clinical treatment after appropriate validation in patient populations.</p>

<p>Nuclear DNA in eukaryotes is wrapped around histone proteins to form nucleosomes on a chromatin fiber. Dynamic folding of the chromatin fiber into loops and variations in the degree of chromatin compaction regulate essential processes such as transcription, recombination, and mitotic chromosome segregation. Our understanding of the physical properties that allow chromatin to be dynamically remodeled even in highly compacted states is limited. Previously, we reported that chromatin has an intrinsic capacity to phase separate and form dynamic liquid-like condensates, which can be regulated by cellular factors [B. A. Gibson </p>
